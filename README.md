# Network Analysis of Antibiotic Resistance Patterns in *Escherichia coli*

This repository contains the Python scripts and datasets used in my Master's Final Project.

## 📂 Main Files

- `Main.py`: General analysis and coordination script.
- `Nan_analysis.py`: Analysis of missing data (Section 2.3).
- `MIC_Coloring_Analysis.py`: MIC resistance profile coloring (Section 4.4).
- `Geographic_Similarity_Network.py`: Construction of similarity network with geographical data (Section 4.3).

## 📁 Dataset

The main dataset (`2024_05_28 atlas_antibiotics.csv`) is not uploaded due to size limitations.
